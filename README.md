# Project 4: Around The U.S.

I'm testing branches as well as using JavaScript that interacts with the HTML and CSS.

## Recent Updates:

The project now has correct modular mobile layout, pixel perfect has been utilized, remove/add classlist are used

### A description of the project.

The point of this website is to practice using JavaScript and work more with branches in Git. I work in the features/ branches and merge those changes into the developer branch and finally push that code into main. Once I get feedback I use hotfix branches and merge into main. JavaScript I'm using to like images and to create functionality to a form.

### Sections

-Header: Houses the logo

-Profile: Where my avatar is based along with form contents. The profile also holds the add picture button.

-Elements: Where my images are kept. These cards also hold the name of the places as well as the Like button (heart).

-Footer: Copyright, title, year

-Form: Two inputs, title, save button, close button
